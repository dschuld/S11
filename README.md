# hundredtickets
hundredtickets is a modular Javascript application that lets you create online maps with rich content. It has a modularized, plugin-based architecture that can easily be extended with new components. It uses minimal external dependencies and is implemented with backend services running in the cloud.

The app lets you 
- Show geographical features such as routes, regions and places on the map
- Connect these features to external data sources to show additional information, such as displaying a YouTube video when clicking on a place icon
- Connect the application to a Wordpress blog and assign blog entries to your map features - Show your blog post excerpts on the map when you click a place or route
- Access your Flickr account from the app and show geotagged photos at the point they were taken
- Access your own location and show a marker on the map to indicate where in the world you are right now
